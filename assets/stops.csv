The Synagogue was first located at 214 West Washington Avenue and was designed and built by the first group of Jewish immigrants as a house of worship from 1863 to 1879.

4,Langdon Hall Apartments,stop4.mp3,43.0757597,-89.3969137,"This apartment building used to be a private all women's dormitory. A Jewish girl from Chicago, Mildred Gordon, and many other girls were denied access to Langdon Hall. The reasoning the landlords gave Mildred was that the dormitory made an iron-bound policy that denies Jewish girls from the dorms. Gordon states that she sent in an application and when she arrived she was barred from a room and was not refunded and sent away. After she filed a $10,000 lawsuit against the dorm, other girls came out saying they were treated similarly.","Walk down State Street, turn right onto Lake Street, and then right again onto Langdon Street",stop4.jpg

The construction of a new Hillel Building began on April 3, 1955, and it was finished on October 23, 1956. The structure, which is now at 611 Langdon Street, cost $250,000 to construct (with furnishings). In commemoration of Louis Behr, the future president of Hillel, who attended the university from 1924 to 1928, the structure was given the name Behr Memorial. The Barbara Hochberg Center for Jewish Student Life was constructed in 2008 after the Behr Memorial Building, which had been serving the campus's Jewish students for more than 50 years, was demolished. UW Hillel offers more than 43,000 square feet of space for students to study, have special events, eat, and work out. Five thousand Jewish students from all over the country and the world attend Hillel today. Hillel supports all facets of Jewish life and is home to over 30 Jewish student organizations.
